# Tasklist

- **Design** the full Hybrid Retrieval + RAG + LLM system with warm-up fallback, ElevenLabs Turbo TTS, and per-save-file game state — _Assigned to Nathan_.  
- **Develop** the hybrid Retrieval + RAG backend API to handle player queries, embedding search, and LLM fallback — _Assigned to Nathan_.  
- **Implement** preset dialogue and warm-up fallback layer for NPCs to ensure smooth interaction during LLM cold starts — _Assigned to Nathan_.  
- **Integrate** ElevenLabs Turbo TTS for asynchronous NPC voice generation and streaming to the client — _Assigned to Nathan_.  
- **Test** end-to-end latency for Retrieval hits, LLM generation, and TTS streaming under concurrent player load — _Assigned to Nathan_.  
- **Design** the complete narrative framework, including the murder mystery plotline, investigation structure, and branching story paths — _Assigned to Faith_.  
- **Develop** character profiles for all suspects, witnesses, and secondary NPCs, specifying their backstories, motivations, and narrative roles — _Assigned to Faith_.  
- **Create** 2D visual assets for environments, characters, items, and user interface elements consistent with the detective game’s artistic direction — _Assigned to Faith_.  
- **Specify** and document the game’s art style guide, including visual tone, color palette, and atmosphere to ensure consistency across assets — _Assigned to Faith_.  
- **Implement** narrative constraints and dialogue guidelines for NPCs to ensure LLM-generated responses remain consistent with character backstories and story canon — _Assigned to Faith_.
- **Implement** the 2D visual assets into the game environment for use in the layout of levels and placement of objects and NPCs — _Assigned to Elias_.
- **Design** the layout of the game environment in a way that is aesthetically pleasing and feels intuitive for the player to navigate in  — _Assigned to Elias_.
- **Develop** the text and movement systems that allows the player to interact with NPC dialogue and navigate the game environment.  — _Assigned to Elias_.
- **Develop** the save data system that allows the player to save the current state of the game (items collected, dialogue options explored) and allow that data to be read and loaded later  — _Assigned to Elias_.
- **Design** the trustworthiness stat that changes how the player can interact with the game environment and NPCs based on how much they "trust" the player  — _Assigned to Elias_.
- **Design** and implement a scalable save file format that structures player state data for persistence and LLM context integration.  — _Assigned to Elias_.
- **Develop** a client-server request system that retrieves text responses from the backend and renders them in an interactive in-game textbox.  — _Assigned to Elias_.
- **Create** a developer-facing debug system that streamlines testing through variable inspection, event triggers, and gameplay simulation tools.  — _Assigned to Elias_.
- **Implement** the foundational NPC interaction system to enable core player-character dialogue and engagement mechanics.  — _Assigned to Elias_.
- **Prototype** initial room environments to establish gameplay flow and functional structure before final asset integration and layout design.  — _Assigned to Elias_.
