# Redstring: AI-Powered 2D Detective Game

## Project Overview

This project explores the integration of artificial intelligence into interactive storytelling through the development of a 2D detective game where players investigate a murder mystery. Unlike traditional scripted dialogue trees, this game leverages large language model (LLM) agents connected to an AWS-hosted backend, enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to dynamically respond to player questions in natural language.

Players can interrogate suspects and witnesses either by typing or speaking, and the AI agents provide contextually relevant clues, enhancing immersion and replayability.

This project demonstrates the application of cloud computing, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction to game development, showcasing how intelligent NPCs can enrich narrative-driven gameplay.

## Project Phases

*   **Semester 1:** Systems design, narrative planning, and backend architecture.
*   **Semester 2:** Implementation of the game, AI dialogue system, and AWS integration.

## Team

This project is a capstone project for the University of Cincinnati.

The team members are:
* Nathan Nguyen
* Faith Rider
* Elias Weitfle
* **Advisor:** Jillian Aurisano

### Budget
Our team did not incur any expenses during the Fall semester. All development work was completed using open-source tools, university-provided software licenses, and free-tier cloud services, resulting in a total cost of $0 for this term. No hardware, software, or external assets were purchased, and no items were donated.

Looking ahead to next semester, we anticipate a small cost associated with hosting and running the AI components of our game, particularly for cloud compute and possible text-to-speech usage. These costs are expected to remain minimal and will be finalized once the backend infrastructure is fully implemented.
