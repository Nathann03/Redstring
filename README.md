# AI-Powered 2D Detective Game

## Project Overview

This project explores the integration of artificial intelligence into interactive storytelling through the development of a 2D detective game where players investigate a murder mystery. Unlike traditional scripted dialogue trees, this game leverages large language model (LLM) agents connected to an AWS-hosted backend, enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to dynamically respond to player questions in natural language.

Players can interrogate suspects and witnesses either by typing or speaking, and the AI agents provide contextually relevant clues, enhancing immersion and replayability.

This project demonstrates the application of cloud computing, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction to game development, showcasing how intelligent NPCs can enrich narrative-driven gameplay.

## Project Phases

*   **Semester 1:** Systems design, narrative planning, and backend architecture.
*   **Semester 2:** Implementation of the game, AI dialogue system, and AWS integration.
